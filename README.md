# Event Planning Site — React (CRA) Starter

This is a simple **React** starter I built to sketch UI/flows for an event-planning site before moving the real app to **Next.js**. It’s a learning sandbox: components, layout, and basic front-end behavior (no backend).

## What’s Here

* Componentized UI for event-planning pages (hero/sections/forms/placeholders).
* Lightweight styling (plain CSS) for quick iteration.
* Built to explore patterns I later used in the Next.js version.

## Tech

* **React** (Create React App)
* **JavaScript + CSS**
* No backend/CMS — front-end only prototype.

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start       # runs on http://localhost:3000
```

## Scripts

```bash
npm start       # dev server with hot reload
npm test        # run tests in watch mode
npm run build   # production build to /build
npm run eject   # one-way: exposes CRA config
```

## Project Structure

```
/public         # index.html, static assets
/src            # components, pages, styles, app entry (index.js/App.js)
```

## Notes / Intent

* Keep it simple and fast for UI prototyping.
* No data layer here — just structure and flow.
* Extract what works and port to the production Next.js stack later.
